# LocalAI UI

This folder contains a minimal [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) project powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Available Scripts

- `npm install` – install dependencies
- `npm run dev` – start the development server
- `npm run build` – build for production (Tailwind is bundled via PostCSS)
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build

The dev server proxies requests starting with `/api` to `http://localhost:8080` so it can be served alongside the Go backend.
